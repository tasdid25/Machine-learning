It allows us to group data together, call aggregate functions and combine the results in three steps *split-apply-combine*: <br>\n","Before we move on to the hands-on, let's try to understand how this split-apply-combine work, using a data in different colours!\n","\n","* **Split:** In this process, data contained in a pandas object (e.g. Series, DataFrame) is split into groups based on one or more keys that we provide. The splitting is performed on a particular axis of an object. For example, a DataFrame can be grouped on its rows (axis=0) or its columns (axis=1). <br>\n","* **apply:** Once splitting is done, a function is applied to all groups independently, producing a new value.\n","* **combine:** Finally, the results of all those functions applications are combined into a resultant object.
